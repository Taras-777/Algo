## Your tasks will be to implement Dijkstra's algorithm and build a tree of the shortest paths from a given vertex for an oriented, weighted graph. The solution will be the average path length from a given vertex to all other vertices that can be reached with s.


## How to run:
 - Git clone https://github.com/Taras-777/Algo.git
 - Run the code in the code editor
